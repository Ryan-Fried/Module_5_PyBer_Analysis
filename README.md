# Module_5_PyBer_Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was, firstly, to create a concise, easily digestible dataframe summarizing the results of our PyBer analysis of ride-sharing data by city type. Secondly, we created a line graph to display the data on a weekly timeframe, providing a visual representation of some of the data presented in the summary dataframe. Overall, this analysis displays to the leadership at PyBer how various data points differ in regards to rural, suburban, and urban cities in order to better inform future business decisions.

# Results

Evidenced by the summary dataframe, seen below, the volume for urban cities is by far the highest with 1,625 rides between 01-01-2019 and 05-08-2019, followed by suburban and lastly rural with 625 and 125 rides, respectively, over the same period. As one might expect, this difference in volume is reflected across the other data points, with urban cities hosting nearly 5 times as many drivers as suburban cities and over 30 times as many as rural cities. Additionally, this discrepancy carries over to the total fares per city type, however, the difference is not quite as drastic. Urban cities saw $39,854.38	in total fares, just over double that of suburban cities, and about 9 times that of rural cities. To make up for the scarcity of drivers in rural (and to a lesser extend suburban) areas, fares per ride and per driver are much higher than in urban cities, where both total rides and total drivers are much more abundant. The fares per ride are slightly more expensive in rural areas than in urban areas, with suburban fares falling directly between. Notably, because there are so few drivers in rural areas compared to urban areas, the fares per driver are more than triple in rural areas vs. urban areas ($55.49 compared to $16.57, with suburban areas falling in the middle with $39.50). This data is displayed in the summary dataframe seen below:

The multiple-line graph shown below represents the total fares for each city type each week from January through April. Relatively little new information can be inferred by the graph, which mainly serves to visually illustrate the discrepancy of total fares between the different city types. As explained above, this discrepancy makes sense given the signifant difference in the number of drives and rides given in urban cities as opposed to suburban and rural cities.

# Summary

In order to make business recommendations, I think it is important to determine some estimation of cause and effect between the different data points by answering such questions as "Are the number of rides limited by demand or by available drivers in an area, or vice versa?", and "How do average fares in area encourage or discourage drivership and ridership?". One glaring observation that I would suggest acting on would be that there seems to be an overabundance of drivers in urban cities, where the number of drivers is far higher than the number of rides. Thus if we reduce the number of drivers in urban cities, we can increase the average fares per driver without significantly impacting the fares per ride or the availability of rides, potentially boosting the profitability of urban cities significantly. If possible, I would suggest the leadership conduct an additional analysis making use of real world population data in order to attempt to more definitively answer these and other such questions. This analysis could provide an understanding of how dependent ridership is on drivership as well as how dependent drivership is on ridership demand by comparing the amount of drivers per capita and rides per capita in a given city, or a given city type. With this information, suggestions could be made to hire more or fewer drivers in certain city types to best fit estimated demand. It is already clear that fewer drivers should be hired in urban areas, as there are nearly 50% more drivers in urban cities than there are total rides. It is also important to understand if the rate drivers are paid changes in porportion to the average fares per driver, as this may complicate profitability of rural cities as opposed to urban cities, even though urban cities earn less per ride and per driver, though this may not be as extreme if the previously suggested change is implemented. Once this factor is understood, we can allocate more drivers to cities or cities types that will be more profitable overall, even if they have lower per ride or per driver fares than other sectors. Finally, by expanding the line graph to display data for longer periods of time, we can observe longer term trends. These trends might indicate seasonal peaks and troughs in ridership and in profitability, suggesting that the PyBer leadership should perhaps reallocate resources and drivers to different cities or city types seasonally, monthly, or even weekly based on projected demand.
