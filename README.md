# Module_5_PyBer_Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was, firstly, to create a concise, easily digestible dataframe summarizing the results of our PyBer analysis of ride-sharing data by city type. Secondly, we created a line graph to display the data on a weekly timeframe, providing a visual representation of some of the data presented in the summary dataframe. Overall, this analysis displays to the leadership at PyBer how various data points differ in regards to rural, suburban, and urban cities in order to better inform future business decisions.

# Results

Evidenced by the summary dataframe, seen below, the volume for urban cities is by far the highest with 1,625 rides between 01-01-2019 and 05-08-2019, followed by suburban and lastly rural with 625 and 125 rides, respectively, over the same period. As one might expect, this difference in volume is reflected across the other data points, with urban cities hosting nearly 5 times as many drivers as suburban cities and over 30 times as many as rural cities. Additionally, this discrepancy carries over to the total fares per city type, however, the difference is not quite as drastic. Urban cities saw $39,854.38	in total fares, just over double that of suburban cities, and about 9 times that of rural cities. To make up for the scarcity of drivers in rural (and to a lesser extend suburban) areas, fares per ride and per driver are much higher than in urban cities, where both total rides and total drivers are much more abundant. The fares per ride are slightly more expensive in rural areas than in urban areas, with suburban fares falling directly between. Notably, because there are so few drivers in rural areas compared to urban areas, the fares per driver are more than triple in rural areas vs. urban areas ($55.49 compared to $16.57, with suburban areas falling in the middle with $39.50). This data is displayed in the summary dataframe seen below:
